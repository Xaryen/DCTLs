# Davinci Resolve CTLs
## Minimax
Basically recreates the minimax effect, since DCTLs aren't good for spacial operations the performance falls off a cliff for higher values so this is mostly meant for ease for comparing values directly between AE and Resolve.
For production uses I recommend using the Alpha Matte Shrink and Grow OFX.
